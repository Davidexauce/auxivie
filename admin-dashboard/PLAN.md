# Admin Dashboard Frontend Project Plan

## Goal
Initialize the Next.js admin dashboard project and establish the foundation for the frontend features as listed in the task list.

## Initialization Steps
- Initialize a Next.js project inside the `admin-dashboard` directory using default settings with JavaScript.
- Setup project structure with the following folders:
  - pages/ : Next.js pages directory
  - components/ : reusable UI components
  - styles/ : CSS or styling files
- Include basic README with instructions to run and develop the project.

## Frontend Implementation Roadmap (Priority Order)
1. User management UI:
   - List users, view user details.
   - Add, edit, suspend users.
2. Documents review UI for auxiliaries:
   - Show documents list.
   - Approve/refuse document verification.
3. Reservation management views:
   - View and manage reservations.
4. Payments overview and detail pages:
   - Show payment summaries and details.
5. Reviews and disputes management UI:
   - List and manage reviews and disputes.
6. Platform settings management UI:
   - Configure platform-wide settings.
7. API integration and admin authentication:
   - Connect to backend APIs.
   - Handle admin login/logout and permissions.

## Technology Stack
- Next.js (React framework) with JavaScript by default
- Optional: CSS Modules or any CSS framework when preferred (Tailwind, etc. can be added later)

## Next Steps after Initialization
- Start working on User Management UI pages and components.
- Iterate with backend API integration in later phase.

## Running the Project
- Use `npm run dev` to start local development server on http://localhost:3000
- Use `npm run build` and `npm start` for production builds.

Please confirm if this plan looks good to you and specify any additional preferences or changes. Once confirmed, I will proceed to initialize the Next.js project with the above details.
